A more aesthetic assembly is also achieved, reducing the visibility of the connections.</p><p>They are used in different industrial and construction sectors. A4 stainless steel versions allow their use in nautical applications or inclement weather.</p><p>For proper use of the cable clamp, the distance between fastenings must be between 1.5 and 3 times its width.</p>",
